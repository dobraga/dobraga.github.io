<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Friends</h1>
<p>Segundo a WikiPedia: "Friends é uma sitcom americana criada por David Crane e
Marta Kauffman e apresentada pela rede de televisão NBC entre 22 de setembro
de 1994 e 6 de maio de 2004, com um total de 236 episódios. A série girava em
torno de um grupo de amigos que vivia no bairro de Greenwich Village, na ilha
de Manhattan, na cidade de Nova York.</p>
<p>O programa já foi transmitido em dezenas de países e as reprises de seus
episódios continuam com boas audiências. O seriado arrecadou seis Prêmios
Emmy (incluindo um na categoria Emmy do Primetime para Melhor Série de
Comédia), um Globo de Ouro, dois SAG Awards, e 56 outros prêmios com 152
nomeações. Em 2002, a revista especializada em televisão TV Guide lançou uma
lista com os 50 melhores programas de televisão de todos os tempos, e Friends
constava em 21º lugar."</p>

<p>Como temos mais de 200 episódios para buscar as informações seria muito demorado
fazer a busca sequencialmente, por isso, será feita uma busca em paralelo, para
efeito de comparação a busca de 10 episódios sequencialmente demora por volta de:</p>

<pre><code>## 21.689 sec elapsed</code></pre>
